# CL Converter Master

Simple vb.net program to process sepcific archives of rtf files by de-archiving, converting to docx format, 
renaming according to specific filename scheme (hard-coded) and re-zipping converted files.

For the moment, working in two branches, master and ooxml. 
This is master branch, using a Word application to handle rtf conversion
to docx. Slow.
